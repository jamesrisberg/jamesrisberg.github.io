      <p>
        In the summer of 2019, I was traveling in my camper van moving south
        through Utah on my way back to the SF Bay Area post EMT training in
        Wyoming.
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        At a coffee shop (with great wifi) just outside the gates of Zion
        National Park, I was approached and offered a fresh fig, then a second,
        by a lovely man named Matthew. Matthew turned out to be a Trappist monk
        working in town for the summer at the park and a local school, and we
        hit it off immediately.
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        We kept in touch over the months, checking in on his efforts to share
        his wisdom and knowledge, and how I might help: what was born was the
        idea of a podcast, and we executed on the idea over the rest of 2019.
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        Eleven Sunday mornings spent talking about what was alive in our hearts
        and the world. Eleven recorded conversations between me and Matthew the
        monk. Enjoy :)
