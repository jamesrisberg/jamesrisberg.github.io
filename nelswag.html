      <p>
        In 2017 I came across a scene on Twitter I dubbed Esoteric Bitcoin
        Twitter, discussing bitcoin as an information system, the blockchain as
        a timechain, the far future implications of digital permanence, Satoshi
        as a quantum superintelligence working backward through time, and a
        vision for a global interconnected hypertextual publishing and writing
        tool called Xanadu. I was intrigued.
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        Xanadu turned out to the be the vision of a legendary figure named Ted
        Nelson. A visionary and a prophet, he foretold the coming computer wave
        and coined the term ‚Äúhypertext‚Äù in the early 70s, dreamed into the world
        we would access through interactive digital screens, and by the 90s had
        developed a theory of the structure of information and a plan for the
        hypertextual information system that would become home to human
        thinking, reading, writing, and conversing and thereby usher in a golden
        age of knowledge and communication.
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        At the time, I was a free agent and decided the OG hypertext prophet was
        someone to meet. I went to the DWeb Summit hosted by the Internet
        Archive, met Ted, and began a relationship that led to a bit over a year
        of spending 3-4 days a week with him: talking and helping him to sift
        through the sprawling and magnificent archives of 70 years of
        hyperdimensional existence at the edge of art, story, information, and
        technology.
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>We became friends.</p>

      <br />

      <p>
        Ted wrote many books, and a whole deal more, but two of his titles stand
        the test of time and became his famous works: Computer Lib and Literary
        Machines.
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        Of these two volumes, I‚Äôve been entrusted with the remaining first and
        second printings along with various paraphernalia and related artifacts.
        My goal is to find appreciative homes for them all, aiming for both
        cultural impact and ensured stewardship of the books.
