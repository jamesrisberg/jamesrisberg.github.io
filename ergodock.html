    <h3>Ergonomics are cool</h3>

    <div>
      <p>
        In 2020, for some reason, I started to stay home a lot more all of a
        sudden.
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        I was back visiting family at the time beginning an oral history project
        with my grandmothers üëµ
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        I went down the rabbit hole on ergonomic desk setups, setting out to
        make the long hours in the digital cockpit less taxing on my corporeal
        form. I discovered proper monitor height and angle, I discovered sitting
        styles and posture methodology. I discovered the split keyboard and the
        angled keyboard, like the beautiful and solid Ergodox EZ
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        I learned about the proper angle at which the wrist begins to strain,
        and I discovered that there were even ergonomic mice that were vertical
        to reduce strain.
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        The only problem is that I do not use a mouse. I use a trackpad. The
        Apple Magic Trackpad in fact, a standalone trackpad that works super
        seamlessly and wonderfully with my MacBook and that I love dearly with
        all of its many gestures and fine control.
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        I started quick and dirty by leaning it up on things or sticking stuff
        underneath, but this isn‚Äôt really reliable or pleasant as a workspace
        accessory. So I began shopping for an ergonomic solution to using the
        Magic Trackpad but what I found was nothing. One project here or there
        from someone with a complicated 3D printed solution online that was
        never actualized perhaps.
      </p>

      <br />

      <h3>Ergodock (working title) is born</h3>

      <p>
        Thus was born the Ergodock: a single piece of anodized metal in a
        pleasing shape, designed for the Apple Magic Trackpad to nest into and
        of fine quality that will look right at home next to your MacBook Pro.
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        The market for such an artifact strikes me as ergo nerds like myself,
        fancy designer types, or maybe serious CAD modelers, people with
        permanent and artful desk setups that use the Magic Trackpad regularly
        and would invest in a stationary dock.
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        This is a somewhat wealthy market, so I figure a premium, small run,
        finely produced artifact may be the perfect solution and in fact aligns
        conveniently with my interest in learning how to take just such a
        physical product through its whole lifecycle.
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        As for design, I took inspiration from Apple products themselves of
        course, and from some projects I admire in the ‚Äúfine consumer objects‚Äù
        game. The brands or studios I admired seem to share an uncompromising
        taste in materials and thoughtful simplicity without sterility.
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        I‚Äôve been taking inspiration from the noble cresting wave as well, I‚Äôve
        always seen one in the swoop of the vertical mouse
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        My non-exhaustive inspiration list for how to bring objects into the
        world so far:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Benjamin Edgar <a href="benjaminedgar.com">benjaminedgar.com</a>
        </li>
        <li>Walden <a href="walden.us">walden.us</a></li>
        <li>Apple (thanks Jony)</li>
        <li>Ergodox <a href="ergodox-ez.com">ergodox-ez.com</a></li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Progress So Far</h3>

      <p>
        I worked with a 3D designer via Upwork to produce V1 and I had it
        printed by a friend in Denver. It‚Äôs huge üòÇ
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        This was to get the basic angles and experiment with the wrist rest.
        What I learned is that I‚Äôm definitely gonna want a separate wrist rest
        like the inspirational Ergodox EZ keyboard (shown above)
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        Then I worked with the lead engineer at my company in 2022 to refine and
        evolve the design for v2, which we printed in the office and was used by
        the CEO who swears by it! Mainly I removed the wrist rest (giving him
        one of my ergodox rests to use with it), and moved from a sort of slot
        that you slide the trackpad into to a simple recession that the pad can
        be dropped into.
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        v3 I updated with new (really weird) angles and printed recently and is
        in pilot use: I expect to sand it down over time to find the right
        angle.
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        The angle needs to enable you to simultaneously reach the whole surface,
        press against the pad firmly with multiple fingers, and line up with the
        wrist so scrolling and panning doesn‚Äôt send you off at unexpected
        angles.
      </p>
