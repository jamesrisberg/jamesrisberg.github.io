      <p>
        In June 2020, I moved onto a beautiful property amidst the redwoods in
        the Santa Cruz Mountains.
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        While here, I completed a program called Building Beauty, a one-year
        graduate program in architecture and design centered on the concepts,
        principles, and process of Christopher Alexander.
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        Much can and will be said on Christopher Alexander and how I came to be
        familiar with his work, but for now, much Building Beauty related
        content can be found exploring my X thread
        <a href="https://x.com/JimmyRis/status/1313543525129089025">here</a>.
